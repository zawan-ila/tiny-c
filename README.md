# tiny-c

# A C compiler in javascript
tiny-c is a hobby compiler for a small subset of C :blush: This implementation of [8 queens](Tests/8queens.c) is an example of what tiny-c can handle today. For more examples and features, check out the [Tests](Tests) directory 

## Usage
`node cc.js <source file>`

## Features

Generates x86-32 assembly in GAS syntax, which is then assembled and linked by GCC.

Has support for: 

- Integers and Integer Arrays only
- `~`, `-`, `!`
- `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `&&`, `||`, `<`, `>`, `>=`, `<=`, `==`, `!=`
- All ops have precedence as defined by the C standard
- Local and Global variables
- For loops
- If Else conditionals and the `?:` operator
- C scoping
- Functions

## Implementation

### Lexer

The lexer is implemented in `[clex.js](clex.js)`. It uses simple regex matching to tokenize the source file

### Parser

The parser is implemented in `[cpars.js](cpars.js)`. It uses recursive descent for everything.

### ASM Generator

The code generator is implemented in `[cgen.js](cgen.js)`. It takes is the AST generated by the parser, traverses and generates assembly code.
